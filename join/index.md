Furthermore, we are committed to maintaining a supportive and collaborative lab environment.

We currently do not have any funded position for undergraduate or graduate
students.

I am always happy to chat about independent study, Master's
degree research projects, and volunteer research opportunities.

Please fill out this form if you are interested in working with the MRRP lab. The first step will be a conversation about your goals for your future career (in academia, industry, or other ventures).
