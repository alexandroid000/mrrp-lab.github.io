# Our research

Our research goal is to develop novel computational approaches to designing and
controlling mobile robots, especially for tasks in challenging environments
such as forests and underwater. To do this, we identify environment structures
that can assist mobile robots in localization, navigation, and other sub-tasks
and we intentionally design the robot hardware and software to leverage this
environment structure. The most famous examples of this approach are robot
vacuums -- the early models did zero mapping or localization and relied on
stochastic coverage guarantees to guarantee they will eventually cover an
entire floor just by turning randomly when a bump sensor is triggered.

By minimizing the resources used by each robot, we can make multi-robot systems more
scalable (both to larger numbers and smaller robots). Our research group also
looks at distributed algorithms for large multi-agent collectives, with a
special focus on maintaining formal guarantees on collective behavior.

Part of achieving real-world robustness and safety involves the principled design of
interfaces and specifications where humans are in the loop, so our work also involves
human-computer/robot interaction (HCI/HRI) and programming language / API
development.
