- title: Lab Mission
  id: "mission"
  show: True
  body: >
         The lab mission is encompassed by the following themes.
         
         1. **Minimalism**: We want to minimize the resources required by robotic systems (materials, energy, computational time/space) to make robots more sustainable. This is also an interesting area of computer science theory / physics, with the possibility of improving computer-aided robotic system design.

         2. **Mobility**: We are interested in agents that move through their environment (surveying, patrolling, monitoring) and possibly also interact with their environment to effect change (construction, taking samples).

         3. **Resilience**: We are interested in building systems with embodied and/or
            collective intelligence leading to more resilient systems in challenging
            environments. Ideally, robots can leverage structure in their environment
            (obstacles, currents, etc.) to perform their tasks.
            - **Robots**: Agents that perceive, compute, and actuate in the real world (not just simulations).

         4. For the **Planet / People**: Our projects are guided by values of sustainability and intentional design. We tackle basic research and open problems motivated by applications in environmental sciences.
            We also focus on the role of the human in design and deployment of robotic
            systems, and aim to make our technologies accessible, low-cost, and open-source
            where possible.
                 
         **Keywords**: motion planning, robot design, computer-aided design, embodied intelligence, collective intelligence, embodied AI

- title: Core Lab Values
  id: "values"
  show: False
  body: >
        The MRRP Lab highly values scientific integrity. You are expected to
        cite and acknowledge all sources for work that is not your own original output
        (including AI-generated text, rewrites, and image generation).


        We value informal and formal peer-review as the primary self-correcting
        mechanism of science. Giving and recieving feedback are both important
        skills to learn, and we expect you to practice these skills intentionally.


        Our lab focuses on cultivating a growth mindset: everyone has different
        backgrounds and opportunities, and everyone has great potential for growth. As
        Bob Ross says, "anything that you are willing to practice, you can do." Failure
        is expected in research (especially in robotics!) and is nothing more than a learning
        opportunity.

- title: Lab Membership and Access
  id: "expectations"
  show: False
  body: >
        Lab membership is granted after:

        1. The completion of an Intro Project (~10 hours of work); and

        2. Approval by Prof. Nilles


        Lab membership includes:

        - your name + photo + basic info on the lab website

        - fob access to the robotics lab

        - access to the lab discord server

        - the expectation that you will attend lab meetings if allowed by your schedule
 
- title: Communication
  id: "communication"
  show: False
  body: >
        In case of an emergency in the lab, always prioritize calling 911 and
        then call Prof. Nilles (personal contact info will be given to graduate
        students and team leads as necessary).

        General lab-wide communication will happen on Discord and via email. You
        are responsible for checking these channels frequently during working hours.

        When in doubt, *over-communicate* rather than under-communicate! If
        unsure about anything, just ask.

        collaborations with other labs. While travelling, you are representing WWU and
        the lab, so remember to represent the lab to the best of your ability.

        Our lab is located on the ancestral homelands of the Coast Salish Peoples, who have lived in the Salish Sea basin, throughout the San Juan Islands and the North Cascades watershed, from time immemorial.

        We stand in solidarity with indigenous peoples, including the Lummi Nation and the Nooksack Tribe.
