We are part of the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.wwu.edu/).

Research in the lab is focused on the science of designing and controlling
minimalist robots in challenging environments. We are interested in building
tools to incorporate embodied and collective intelligence into multi-robot and
cyber-physical systems, maximizing their capabilities while minimizing overall
system resource usage. Our research spans topics such as resource-denied planning and
control, underactuated robots, robot-environment interactions, energy
harvesting, bio-inspiration/mimicry, automated design and system verification.
