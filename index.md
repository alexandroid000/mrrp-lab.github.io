## Minimalist Resilient Robotics for the Planet

{: .welcomefont}

Our research lab focuses on the design and control of minimalist robots in challenging
environments where environment geometry and dynamics cannot be ignored.

Minimalism is a lens for robotics design that challenges us to solve problems
with *minimal resources* such as energy expenditure, computational complexity,
sensor power, etc. Resulting problems and solutions are interesting from both:

- the theoretical perspective (akin to analyzing algorithm run-time/space
usage); and
- the practical challenge of scaling up ecological data collection and
  restoration with robotic technology, while minimizing our environmental impact.

While investigating the boundary of what is possible, we often study
systems that use embodied intelligence and/or collective intelligence.
Information-processing systems such as robots or animals often
"outsource" information processing to their bodies (reflexes, compliant
interactions) and/or to other agents (swarms, stigmergy, distributed protocols).
We seek to better understand how to rigorously analyze and design such systems
to enhance the resiliency of future mobile robotic systems.

We are part of the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.wwu.edu/) at
Western Washington University. Our group develops algorithms, simulators and computer-aided
design tools for robotic and cyber-physical systems. We aim to bring
theoretical insights to bear on real-world systems, with the goal of maximizing
system capabilities while minimizing overall resource usage.

Our research spans topics such as:

- motion, path, and task planning
- resource-denied planning
- underactuated robots
- robot-environment interactions
- energy harvesting
- bio-inspiration and bio-mimicry
- automated design
- formal verification
