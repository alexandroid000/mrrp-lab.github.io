description: "
Fred loves looking out the window at his new home in Bellingham.
His asthma has gotten much better since moving from Colorado, where he was born
in the height of the 2020 wildfire season. Perhaps because he was born during
the pandemic lockdown, he very much dislikes having guests at home, but he is a
sweet cuddly boy once you get to know him.
